# ## final assignment

# Welcome to my final project notebook. In this notebook, we will explore various aspects of data science, including languages, libraries, tools, and basic arithmetic expressions.

# In data science, various programming languages are used to analyze and manipulate data. Some of them are:
# 
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. SQL
# 4. Julia
# 5. Scala
# 6. Java

# In data science, various libraries are available in different programming languages to facilitate data analysis and visualization and machine learning . Some of them:
# 
# - **Python**:
#   1. NumPy
#   2. Pandas
#   3. Matplotlib
#   4. Seaborn
#   5. Scikit-learn
#   6. TensorFlow
#   7. PyTorch
# 
# - **R**:
#   1. dplyr
#   2. ggplot
#   3. caret
#   
# 
# 
# 

# Data Science Tools
# 
# | Category          | Tools                           |
# |-------------------|---------------------------------|
# | Data Manipulation | Pandas (Python), dplyr (R)      |
# | Data Visualization| Matplotlib (Python), ggplot (R)|
# | Machine Learning  | Scikit-learn (Python), caret (R)|
# | Deep Learning     | TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch (Python) |
# 
# 

# In this section, we'll explore various arithmetic expressions to demonstrate basic mathematical operations such as:
# Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
# 
# After we can find examples of addition and multiplication.
# 

# In[3]:


x=5
y=6

add=y+x

multi=y*x

print("Addition result:", add)
print("Multiplication result:", multi)


# In[6]:


minutes = 240

hours = minutes / 60

print(hours, "hours")


# The main objectives of this project is:
# 
# 1. Understanding basic data science concepts.
# 2. Exploring various data science languages, libraries, and tools.
# 3. Practicing arithmetic expressions and basic operations in programming languages.
# 4. Sharing the final project through GitHub .
# 5. Gaining experience in creating and presenting structured documents using Jupyter Notebook.
